## 🔍 Overview

This project presents a **Transformer-based human detection system** that integrates **RGB, Thermal, and Infrared (IR) imaging** for robust detection in diverse environmental conditions. Built using the DEtection TRansformer (DETR) model, the system improves detection accuracy in scenarios such as low-light, occlusion, and cluttered backgrounds.
